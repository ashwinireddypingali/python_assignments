       "'\\n\\nThe United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization tasked with maintaining international peace and security, developing friendly relations among nations, achieving international co-operation, and being a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations.[3] It was established after World War II, with the aim of preventing future wars, and succeeded the ineffective League of Nations.[4] Its headquarters, which are subject to extraterritoriality, are in Manhattan, New York City, and it has other main offices in Geneva, Nairobi, Vienna and The Hague. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, protecting human rights, delivering humanitarian aid, promoting sustainable development, and upholding international law.[5] The UN is the largest, most familiar, most internationally represented and most powerful intergovernmental organization in the world. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193.\\nOn 25 April 1945, 50 governments met in San Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter, which was adopted on 25 June 1945 in the San Francisco Opera House, and signed on 26 June 1945 in the Herbst Theatre auditorium in the Veterans War Memorial Building. This charter took effect on 24 October 1945, when the UN began operations. The organisation\\'s mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades during the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies. Its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring, reporting and confidence-building roles.[6] The organization\\'s membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization which started in the 1960s. Since then, 80 former colonies had gained independence, including 11 trust territories, which were monitored by the Trusteeship Council.[7] By the 1970s its budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping. After the end of the Cold War, the UN shifted and expanded its field operations, undertaking a wide variety of complex tasks.[8]\\nThe UN has six principal organs: the General Assembly; the Security Council; the Economic and Social Council; the Trusteeship Council; the International Court of Justice; and the UN Secretariat. The UN System agencies include the World Bank Group, the World Health Organization, the World Food Programme, UNESCO, and UNICEF. The UN\\'s most prominent officer is the Secretary-General, an office held by Portuguese politician and diplomat António Guterres since 1 January 2017. Non-governmental organizations may be granted consultative status with ECOSOC and other agencies to participate in the UN\\'s work.\\nThe organization, its officers, and its agencies have won many Nobel Peace Prizes. Other evaluations of the UN\\'s effectiveness have been mixed. Some commentators believe the organization to be an important force for peace and human development, while others have called the organization ineffective, biased, or corrupt.\\nIn the century prior to the UN\\'s creation, several international treaty organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross was formed to ensure protection and assistance for victims of armed conflict and strife.[9]\\nIn 1914, a political assassination in Sarajevo set off a chain of events that led to the outbreak of World War I. As more and more young men were sent down into the trenches, influential voices in the United States and Britain began calling for the establishment of a permanent international body to maintain peace in the postwar world. President Woodrow Wilson became a vocal advocate of this concept, and in 1918 he included a sketch of the international body in his 14-point proposal to end the war. In November 1918, the Central Powers agreed to an armistice to halt the killing in World War I. Two months later, the Allies met with Germany and Austria-Hungary at Versailles to hammer out formal peace terms. President Wilson wanted peace, but the United Kingdom and France disagreed, forcing harsh war reparations on their former enemies. The League of Nations was approved, and in the summer of 1919 Wilson presented the Treaty of Versailles and the Covenant of the League of Nations to the US Senate for ratification. On January 10, 1920, the League of Nations formally comes into being when the Covenant of the League of Nations, ratified by 42 nations in 1919, takes effect.[10] \\nHowever, at some point the League became ineffective when it failed to act against the Japanese invasion of Manchuria as in February 1933, 40 nations voted for Japan to withdraw from Manchuria but Japan voted against it and walked out of the League instead of withdrawing from Manchuria.[11] It also failed against the Second Italo-Ethiopian War despite trying to talk to Benito Mussolini as he used the time to send an army to Africa, so the League had a plan for Mussolini to just take a part of Ethiopia, but he ignored the League and invaded Ethiopia, the League tried putting sanctions on Italy, but Italy had already conquered Ethiopia and the League had failed.[12] After Italy conquered Ethiopia, Italy and other nations left the league. But all of them realised that it had failed and they began to re-arm as fast as possible.\\nDuring 1938, Britain and France tried negotiating directly with Hitler but this failed in 1939 when Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia.\\nWhen war broke out in 1939, the League closed down and its headquarters in Geneva remained empty throughout the war.[13]\\nThe earliest concrete plan for a new world organization began under the aegis of the U.S. State Department in 1939.[14] The text of the \"Declaration by United Nations\" was drafted at the White House on December 29, 1941, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Roosevelt aide Harry Hopkins. It incorporated Soviet suggestions, but left no role for France. \"Four Policemen\" was coined to refer to four major Allied countries, United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and Republic of China, which emerged in the Declaration by United Nations.[15] Roosevelt first coined the term United Nations to describe the Allied countries.[b]  \"On New Year\\'s Day 1942, President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Churchill, Maxim Litvinov, of the USSR, and T. V. Soong, of China, signed a short document which later came to be known as the United Nations Declaration and the next day the representatives of twenty-two other nations added their signatures.\"[16] The term United Nations was first officially used when 26 governments signed this Declaration. One major change from the Atlantic Charter was the addition of a provision for religious freedom, which Stalin approved after Roosevelt insisted.[17][18] By 1 March 1945, 21 additional states had signed.[19]\\nA JOINT DECLARATION BY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND, THE UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS, CHINA, AUSTRALIA, BELGIUM, CANADA, COSTA RICA, CUBA, CZECHOSLOVAKIA, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, EL SALVADOR, GREECE, GUATEMALA, HAITI, HONDURAS, INDIA, LUXEMBOURG, NETHERLANDS, NEW ZEALAND, NICARAGUA, NORWAY, PANAMA, POLAND, SOUTH AFRICA, YUGOSLAVIA\\nThe Governments signatory hereto,\\nHaving subscribed to a common program of purposes and principles embodied in the Joint Declaration of the President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister of Great Britain dated August 14, 1941, known as the Atlantic Charter,\\nBeing convinced that complete victory over their enemies is essential to defend life, liberty, independence and religious freedom, and to preserve human rights and justice in their own lands as well as in other lands, and that they are now engaged in a common struggle against savage and brutal forces seeking to subjugate the world,\\nDECLARE:\\n\\nThe foregoing declaration may be adhered to by other nations which are, or which may be, rendering material assistance and contributions in the struggle for victory over Hitlerism.During the war, \"the United Nations\" became the official term for the Allies. To join, countries had to sign the Declaration and declare war on the Axis.[20]\\nThe UN was formulated and negotiated among the delegations from the Allied Big Four (the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and China) at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference from 21 September 1944 to October 7, 1944 and they agreed on the aims, structure and functioning of the UN.[21][22][23] After months of planning, the UN Conference on International Organization opened in San Francisco, 25 April 1945, attended by 50 governments and a number of non-governmental organizations involved in drafting the UN Charter.[24][25][26] \"The heads of the delegations of the sponsoring countries took turns as chairman of the plenary meetings: Anthony Eden, of Britain, Edward Stettinius, of the United States, T. V. Soong, of China, and Vyacheslav Molotov, of the Soviet Union. At the later meetings, Lord Halifax deputized for Mister Eden, Wellington Koo for T. V. Soong, and Mister Gromyko for Mister Molotov.\"[27] The UN officially came into existence 24 October 1945, upon ratification of the Charter by the five permanent members of the Security Council—France, the Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the UK and the US—and by a majority of the other 46 signatories.[28]\\nThe first meetings of the General Assembly, with 51 nations represented,[c] and the Security Council took place in Methodist Central Hall, Westminster, London beginning on 10 January 1946.[28] The General Assembly selected New York City as the site for the headquarters of the UN, construction began on 14 September 1948 and the facility was completed on 9 October 1952. Its site—like UN headquarters buildings in Geneva, Vienna, and Nairobi—is designated as international territory.[31] The Norwegian Foreign Minister, Trygve Lie, was elected as the first UN Secretary-General.[28]\\nThough the UN\\'s primary mandate was peacekeeping, the division between the US and USSR often paralysed the organization, generally allowing it to intervene only in conflicts distant from the Cold War.[32] Two notable exceptions were a Security Council resolution on 7 July 1950 authorizing a US-led coalition to repel the North Korean invasion of South Korea, passed in the absence of the USSR,[28][33] and the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement in 27 July 1953.[34]\\nOn 29 November 1947, the General Assembly approved a resolution to partition Palestine, approving the creation of the state of Israel.[35] Two years later, Ralph Bunche, a UN official, negotiated an armistice to the resulting conflict.[36] On November 7, 1956, the first UN peacekeeping force was established to end the Suez Crisis;[37] however, the UN was unable to intervene against the USSR\\'s simultaneous invasion of Hungary following that country\\'s revolution.[38]\\nOn 14 July 1960, the UN established United Nations Operation in the Congo (UNOC), the largest military force of its early decades, to bring order to the breakaway State of Katanga, restoring it to the control of the Democratic Republic of the Congo by 11 May 1964.[39] While travelling to meet rebel leader Moise Tshombe during the conflict, Dag Hammarskjöld, often named as one of the UN\\'s most effective Secretaries-General,[40] died in a plane crash; months later he was posthumously awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.[41] In 1964, Hammarskjöld\\'s successor, U Thant, deployed the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, which would become one of the UN\\'s longest-running peacekeeping missions.[42]\\nWith the spread of decolonization in the 1960s, the organization\\'s membership saw an influx of newly independent nations. In 1960 alone, 17 new states joined the UN, 16 of them from Africa.[37] On 25 October 1971, with opposition from the United States, but with the support of many Third World nations, the mainland, communist People\\'s Republic of China was given the Chinese seat on the Security Council in place of the Republic of China that occupied Taiwan; the vote was widely seen as a sign of waning US influence in the organization.[43] Third World nations organized into the Group of 77 coalition under the leadership of Algeria, which briefly became a dominant power at the UN.[44] On 10 November 1975, a bloc comprising the USSR and Third World nations passed a resolution, over strenuous US and Israeli opposition, declaring Zionism to be racism; the resolution was repealed on 16 December 1991, shortly after the end of the Cold War.[45][46]\\nWith an increasing Third World presence and the failure of UN mediation in conflicts in the Middle East, Vietnam, and Kashmir, the UN increasingly shifted its attention to its ostensibly secondary goals of economic development and cultural exchange.[47] By the 1970s, the UN budget for social and economic development was far greater than its peacekeeping budget.\\nAfter the Cold War, the UN saw a radical expansion in its peacekeeping duties, taking on more missions in ten years than it had in the previous four decades.[48] Between 1988 and 2000, the number of adopted Security Council resolutions more than doubled, and the peacekeeping budget increased more than tenfold.[49][50][51] The UN negotiated an end to the Salvadoran Civil War, launched a successful peacekeeping mission in Namibia, and oversaw democratic elections in post-apartheid South Africa and post-Khmer Rouge Cambodia.[52] In 1991, the UN authorized a US-led coalition that repulsed the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.[53] Brian Urquhart, Under-Secretary-General from 1971 to 1985, later described the hopes raised by these successes as a \"false renaissance\" for the organization, given the more troubled missions that followed.[54]\\nThough the UN Charter had been written primarily to prevent aggression by one nation against another, in the early 1990s the UN faced a number of simultaneous, serious crises within nations such as Somalia, Haiti, Mozambique, and the former Yugoslavia.[55] The UN mission in Somalia was widely viewed as a failure after the US withdrawal following casualties in the Battle of Mogadishu, and the UN mission to Bosnia faced \"worldwide ridicule\" for its indecisive and confused mission in the face of ethnic cleansing.[56] In 1994, the UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda failed to intervene in the Rwandan genocide amid indecision in the Security Council.[57]\\nBeginning in the last decades of the Cold War, American and European critics of the UN condemned the organization for perceived mismanagement and corruption.[58] In 1984, the US President, Ronald Reagan, withdrew his nation\\'s funding from UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, founded 1946) over allegations of mismanagement, followed by Britain and Singapore.[59][60] Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary-General from 1992 to 1996, initiated a reform of the Secretariat, reducing the size of the organization somewhat.[61][62] His successor, Kofi Annan (1997–2006), initiated further management reforms in the face of threats from the United States to withhold its UN dues.[62]\\nIn the late 1990s and 2000s, international interventions authorized by the UN took a wider variety of forms. The UN mission in the Sierra Leone Civil War of 1991–2002 was supplemented by British Royal Marines, and the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 was overseen by NATO.[63]In 2003, the United States invaded Iraq despite failing to pass a UN Security Council resolution for authorization, prompting a new round of questioning of the organization\\'s effectiveness.[64] Under the eighth Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, the UN has intervened with peacekeepers in crises including the War in Darfur in Sudan and the Kivu conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and sent observers and chemical weapons inspectors to the Syrian Civil War.[65] In 2013, an internal review of UN actions in the final battles of the Sri Lankan Civil War in 2009 concluded that the organization had suffered \"systemic failure\".[66] One hundred and one UN personnel died in the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the worst loss of life in the organization\\'s history.[67]\\nThe Millennium Summit was held in 2000 to discuss the UN\\'s role in the 21st century.[68] The three day meeting was the largest gathering of world leaders in history, and culminated in the adoption by all member states of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), a commitment to achieve international development in areas such as poverty reduction, gender equality, and public health. Progress towards these goals, which were to be met by 2015, was ultimately uneven. The 2005 World Summit reaffirmed the UN\\'s focus on promoting development, peacekeeping, human rights, and global security.[69] The Sustainable Development Goals were launched in 2015 to succeed the Millennium Development Goals.[70]\\nIn addition to addressing global challenges, the UN has sought to improve its accountability and democratic legitimacy by engaging more with civil society and fostering a global constituency.[71] In an effort to enhance transparency, in 2016 the organization held its first public debate between candidates for Secretary-General.[72] On 1 January 2017, Portuguese diplomat António Guterres, who previously served as UN High Commissioner for Refugees, became the ninth Secretary-General. Guterres has highlighted several key goals for his administration, including an emphasis on diplomacy for preventing conflicts, more effective peacekeeping efforts, and streamlining the organization to be more responsive and versatile to global needs.[73]\\nThe UN system is based on five principal organs: the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), the International Court of Justice and the UN Secretariat.[74] A sixth principal organ, the Trusteeship Council, suspended operations on 1 November 1994, upon the independence of Palau, the last remaining UN trustee territory.[75]\\nFour of the five principal organs are located at the main UN Headquarters in New York City.[76] The International Court of Justice is located in The Hague, while other major agencies are based in the UN offices at Geneva,[77] Vienna,[78] and Nairobi.[79] Other UN institutions are located throughout the world. The six official languages of the UN, used in intergovernmental meetings and documents, are Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish.[80] On the basis of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, the UN and its agencies are immune from the laws of the countries where they operate, safeguarding the UN\\'s impartiality with regard to the host and member countries.[81]\\nBelow the six organs sit, in the words of the author Linda Fasulo, \"an amazing collection of entities and organizations, some of which are actually older than the UN itself and operate with almost complete independence from it\".[82] These include specialized agencies, research and training institutions, programmes and funds, and other UN entities.[83]\\nThe UN obey the Noblemaire principle, which is binding on any organization that belongs to the UN system. This principle calls for salaries that will draw and keep citizens of countries where salaries are highest, and also calls for equal pay for work of equal value independent of the employee\\'s nationality.[84][85] In practice, the ICSC takes reference to the highest-paying national civil service.[86] Staff salaries are subject to an internal tax that is administered by the UN organizations.[84][87]\\n\\nThe General Assembly is the main deliberative assembly of the UN. Composed of all UN member states, the assembly meets in regular yearly sessions, but emergency sessions can also be called.[89] The assembly is led by a president, elected from among the member states on a rotating regional basis, and 21 vice-presidents.[90] The first session convened 10 January 1946 in the Methodist Central Hall in London and included representatives of 51 nations.[28]\\nWhen the General Assembly decides on important questions such as those on peace and security, admission of new members and budgetary matters, a two-thirds majority of those present and voting is required.[91][92] All other questions are decided by a majority vote. Each member country has one vote. Apart from approval of budgetary matters, resolutions are not binding on the members. The Assembly may make recommendations on any matters within the scope of the UN, except matters of peace and security that are under consideration by the Security Council.[89]\\nDraft resolutions can be forwarded to the General Assembly by its six main committees:[93]\\nAs well as by the following two committees:\\nThe Security Council is charged with maintaining peace and security among countries. While other organs of the UN can only make \"recommendations\" to member states, the Security Council has the power to make binding decisions that member states have agreed to carry out, under the terms of Charter Article 25.[94] The decisions of the Council are known as United Nations Security Council resolutions.[95]\\nThe Security Council is made up of fifteen member states, consisting of five permanent members—China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States—and ten non-permanent members elected for two-year terms by the General Assembly (with end of term date)—Belgium (term ends 2020), Côte d\\'Ivoire (2019), Dominican Republic (2020), Equatorial Guinea (2019), Germany (2020), Indonesia (2020), Kuwait (2019), Peru (2019), Poland (2019), and South Africa (2020).[96] The five permanent members hold veto power over UN resolutions, allowing a permanent member to block adoption of a resolution, though not debate. The ten temporary seats are held for two-year terms, with five member states per year voted in by the General Assembly on a regional basis.[97] The presidency of the Security Council rotates alphabetically each month.[98]\\nThe UN Secretariat is headed by the Secretary-General, assisted by the Deputy Secretary-General and a staff of international civil servants worldwide.[99] It provides studies, information, and facilities needed by UN bodies for their meetings. It also carries out tasks as directed by the Security Council, the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council, and other UN bodies.[100]\\nThe Secretary-General acts as the de facto spokesperson and leader of the UN. The position is defined in the UN Charter as the organization\\'s \"chief administrative officer\".[101] Article 99 of the charter states that the Secretary-General can bring to the Security Council\\'s attention \"any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security\", a phrase that Secretaries-General since Trygve Lie have interpreted as giving the position broad scope for action on the world stage.[102] The office has evolved into a dual role of an administrator of the UN organization and a diplomat and mediator addressing disputes between member states and finding consensus to global issues.[103]\\nThe Secretary-General is appointed by the General Assembly, after being recommended by the Security Council, where the permanent members have veto power. There are no specific criteria for the post, but over the years it has become accepted that the post shall be held for one or two terms of five years.[104] The current Secretary-General is António Guterres, who replaced Ban Ki-moon in 2017.\\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ), located in The Hague, in the Netherlands, is the primary judicial organ of the UN. Established in 1945 by the UN Charter, the Court began work in 1946 as the successor to the Permanent Court of International Justice. The ICJ is composed of 15 judges who serve 9-year terms and are appointed by the General Assembly; every sitting judge must be from a different nation.[106][107]\\nIt is based in the Peace Palace in The Hague, sharing the building with the Hague Academy of International Law, a private centre for the study of international law. The ICJ\\'s primary purpose is to adjudicate disputes among states. The court has heard cases related to war crimes, illegal state interference, ethnic cleansing, and other issues.[108] The ICJ can also be called upon by other UN organs to provide advisory opinions.[106]\\nIt is the only organ that is not located in New York.\\nThe Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) assists the General Assembly in promoting international economic and social co-operation and development. ECOSOC has 54 members, which are elected by the General Assembly for a three-year term. The president is elected for a one-year term and chosen amongst the small or middle powers represented on ECOSOC. The council has one annual meeting in July, held in either New York or Geneva. Viewed as separate from the specialized bodies it co-ordinates, ECOSOC\\'s functions include information gathering, advising member nations, and making recommendations.[109][110] Owing to its broad mandate of co-ordinating many agencies, ECOSOC has at times been criticized as unfocused or irrelevant.[109][111]\\nECOSOC\\'s subsidiary bodies include the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, which advises UN agencies on issues relating to indigenous peoples; the United Nations Forum on Forests, which co-ordinates and promotes sustainable forest management; the United Nations Statistical Commission, which co-ordinates information-gathering efforts between agencies; and the Commission on Sustainable Development, which co-ordinates efforts between UN agencies and NGOs working towards sustainable development. ECOSOC may also grant consultative status to non-governmental organizations;[109] by 2004, more than 2,200 organizations had received this status.[112]\\nThe UN Charter stipulates that each primary organ of the United Nations can establish various specialized agencies to fulfil its duties.[113] Some best-known agencies are the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Food and Agriculture Organization, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), the World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO). The UN performs most of its humanitarian work through these agencies. Examples include mass vaccination programmes (through WHO), the avoidance of famine and malnutrition (through the work of the WFP), and the protection of vulnerable and displaced people (for example, by UNHCR).[114]\\nWith the addition of South Sudan 14 July 2011,[116] there are 193 UN member states, including all undisputed independent states apart from Vatican City.[117][d]\\nThe UN Charter outlines the rules for membership:\\nIn addition, there are two non-member observer states of the United Nations General Assembly: the Holy See (which holds sovereignty over Vatican City) and the State of Palestine.[119] The Cook Islands and Niue, both states in free association with New Zealand, are full members of several UN specialized agencies and have had their \"full treaty-making capacity\" recognized by the Secretariat.[120]\\nThe Group of 77 at the UN is a loose coalition of developing nations, designed to promote its members\\' collective economic interests and create an enhanced joint negotiating capacity in the UN. Seventy-seven nations founded the organization, but by November 2013 the organization had since expanded to 133 member countries.[121] The group was founded 15 June 1964 by the \"Joint Declaration of the Seventy-Seven Countries\" issued at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The group held its first major meeting in Algiers in 1967, where it adopted the Charter of Algiers and established the basis for permanent institutional structures.[122]\\nThe UN, after approval by the Security Council, sends peacekeepers to regions where armed conflict has recently ceased or paused to enforce the terms of peace agreements and to discourage combatants from resuming hostilities. Since the UN does not maintain its own military, peacekeeping forces are voluntarily provided by member states. These soldiers are sometimes nicknamed \"Blue Helmets\" for their distinctive gear.[123][124] The peacekeeping force as a whole received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988.[125]\\nIn September 2013, the UN had peacekeeping soldiers deployed on 15 missions. The largest was the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), which included 20,688 uniformed personnel. The smallest, United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP), included 42 uniformed personnel responsible for monitoring the ceasefire in Jammu and Kashmir. UN peacekeepers with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) have been stationed in the Middle East since 1948, the longest-running active peacekeeping mission.[126]\\nA study by the RAND Corporation in 2005 found the UN to be successful in two out of three peacekeeping efforts. It compared efforts at nation-building by the UN to those of the United States, and found that seven out of eight UN cases are at peace, as compared with four out of eight US cases at peace.[127] Also in 2005, the Human Security Report documented a decline in the number of wars, genocides, and human rights abuses since the end of the Cold War, and presented evidence, albeit circumstantial, that international activism—mostly spearheaded by the UN—has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict in that period.[128] Situations in which the UN has not only acted to keep the peace but also intervened include the Korean War (1950–53) and the authorization of intervention in Iraq after the Gulf War (1990–91).[129]\\n\\nThe UN has also drawn criticism for perceived failures. In many cases, member states have shown reluctance to achieve or enforce Security Council resolutions. Disagreements in the Security Council about military action and intervention are seen as having failed to prevent the Bangladesh genocide in 1971,[130] the Cambodian genocide in the 1970s,[131] and the Rwandan genocide in 1994.[132] Similarly, UN inaction is blamed for failing to either prevent the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 or complete the peacekeeping operations in 1992–93 during the Somali Civil War.[133] UN peacekeepers have also been accused of child rape, soliciting prostitutes, and sexual abuse during various peacekeeping missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,[134] Haiti,[135] Liberia,[136] Sudan and what is now South Sudan,[137] Burundi, and Ivory Coast.[138] Scientists cited UN peacekeepers from Nepal as the likely source of the 2010–13 Haiti cholera outbreak, which killed more than 8,000 Haitians following the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[139]\\nIn addition to peacekeeping, the UN is also active in encouraging disarmament. Regulation of armaments was included in the writing of the UN Charter in 1945 and was envisioned as a way of limiting the use of human and economic resources for their creation.[94] The advent of nuclear weapons came only weeks after the signing of the charter, resulting in the first resolution of the first General Assembly meeting calling for specific proposals for \"the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and of all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction\".[140] The UN has been involved with arms-limitation treaties, such as the Outer Space Treaty (1967), the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (1968), the Seabed Arms Control Treaty (1971), the Biological Weapons Convention (1972), the Chemical Weapons Convention (1992), and the Ottawa Treaty (1997), which prohibits landmines.[141] Three UN bodies oversee arms proliferation issues: the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission.[142]\\nOne of the UN\\'s primary purposes is \"promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion\", and member states pledge to undertake \"joint and separate action\" to protect these rights.[113][143]\\nIn 1948, the General Assembly adopted a Universal Declaration of Human Rights, drafted by a committee headed by American diplomat and activist Eleanor Roosevelt, and including the French lawyer René Cassin. The document proclaims basic civil, political, and economic rights common to all human beings, though its effectiveness towards achieving these ends has been disputed since its drafting.[144] The Declaration serves as a \"common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations\" rather than a legally binding document, but it has become the basis of two binding treaties, the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.[145] In practice, the UN is unable to take significant action against human rights abuses without a Security Council resolution, though it does substantial work in investigating and reporting abuses.[146]\\nIn 1979, the General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, followed by the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989.[147] With the end of the Cold War, the push for human rights action took on new impetus.[148] The United Nations Commission on Human Rights was formed in 1993 to oversee human rights issues for the UN, following the recommendation of that year\\'s World Conference on Human Rights. Jacques Fomerand, a scholar of the UN, describes this organization\\'s mandate as \"broad and vague\", with only \"meagre\" resources to carry it out.[149] In 2006, it was replaced by a Human Rights Council consisting of 47 nations.[150] Also in 2006, the General Assembly passed a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,[151] and in 2011 it passed its first resolution recognizing the rights of LGBT people.[152]\\nOther UN bodies responsible for women\\'s rights issues include United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, a commission of ECOSOC founded in 1946; the United Nations Development Fund for Women, created in 1976; and the United Nations International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women, founded in 1979.[153] The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, one of three bodies with a mandate to oversee issues related to indigenous peoples, held its first session in 2002.[154]\\nMillennium Development Goals[155]\\nAnother primary purpose of the UN is \"to achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character\".[143] Numerous bodies have been created to work towards this goal, primarily under the authority of the General Assembly and ECOSOC.[156] In 2000, the 192 UN member states agreed to achieve eight Millennium Development Goals by 2015.[157] The Sustainable Development Goals were launched in 2015 to succeed the Millennium Development Goals.[70] The SDGs have an associated financing framework called the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.\\nThe UN Development Programme (UNDP), an organization for grant-based technical assistance founded in 1945, is one of the leading bodies in the field of international development. The organization also publishes the UN Human Development Index, a comparative measure ranking countries by poverty, literacy, education, life expectancy, and other factors.[158][159] The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), also founded in 1945, promotes agricultural development and food security.[160] UNICEF (the United Nations Children\\'s Fund) was created in 1946 to aid European children after the Second World War and expanded its mission to provide aid around the world and to uphold the Convention on the Rights of the Child.[161][162]\\nThe World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund (IMF) are independent, specialized agencies and observers within the UN framework, according to a 1947 agreement. They were initially formed separately from the UN through the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1944.[163] The World Bank provides loans for international development, while the IMF promotes international economic co-operation and gives emergency loans to indebted countries.[164]\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO), which focuses on international health issues and disease eradication, is another of the UN\\'s largest agencies. In 1980, the agency announced that the eradication of smallpox had been completed. In subsequent decades, WHO largely eradicated polio, river blindness, and leprosy.[165] The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), begun in 1996, co-ordinates the organization\\'s response to the AIDS epidemic.[166] The UN Population Fund, which also dedicates part of its resources to combating HIV, is the world\\'s largest source of funding for reproductive health and family planning services.[167]\\nAlong with the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the UN often takes a leading role in co-ordinating emergency relief.[168] The World Food Programme (WFP), created in 1961, provides food aid in response to famine, natural disasters, and armed conflict. The organization reports that it feeds an average of 90 million people in 80 nations each year.[168][169] The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), established in 1950, works to protect the rights of refugees, asylum seekers, and stateless people.[170] UNHCR and WFP programmes are funded by voluntary contributions from governments, corporations, and individuals, though the UNHCR\\'s administrative costs are paid for by the UN\\'s primary budget.[171]\\nSince the UN\\'s creation, over 80 colonies have attained independence. The General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in 1960 with no votes against but abstentions from all major colonial powers. The UN works towards decolonization through groups including the UN Committee on Decolonization, created in 1962.[172] The committee lists seventeen remaining \"Non-Self-Governing Territories\", the largest and most populous of which is Western Sahara.[173]\\nBeginning with the formation of the UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) in 1972, the UN has made environmental issues a prominent part of its agenda. A lack of success in the first two decades of UN work in this area led to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which sought to give new impetus to these efforts.[174] In 1988, the UNEP and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), another UN organization, established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which assesses and reports on research on global warming.[175] The UN-sponsored Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, set legally binding emissions reduction targets for ratifying states.[176]\\nThe UN also declares and co-ordinates international observances, periods of time to observe issues of international interest or concern. Examples include World Tuberculosis Day, Earth Day, and the International Year of Deserts and Desertification.[177]\\nThe UN is financed from assessed and voluntary contributions from member states. The General Assembly approves the regular budget and determines the assessment for each member. This is broadly based on the relative capacity of each country to pay, as measured by its gross national income (GNI), with adjustments for external debt and low per capita income.[179] The two-year budget for 2012–13 was $5.512 billion in total.[180]\\nThe Assembly has established the principle that the UN should not be unduly dependent on any one member to finance its operations. Thus, there is a \"ceiling\" rate, setting the maximum amount that any member can be assessed for the regular budget. In December 2000, the Assembly revised the scale of assessments in response to pressure from the United States. As part of that revision, the regular budget ceiling was reduced from 25% to 22%.[181] For the least developed countries (LDCs), a ceiling rate of 0.01% is applied.[179] In addition to the ceiling rates, the minimum amount assessed to any member nation (or \"floor\" rate) is set at 0.001% of the UN budget ($55,120 for the two year budget 2013–2014).[182]\\nA large share of the UN\\'s expenditure addresses its core mission of peace and security, and this budget is assessed separately from the main organizational budget.[183] The peacekeeping budget for the 2015–16 fiscal year was $8.27 billion, supporting 82,318 troops deployed in 15 missions around the world.[126] UN peace operations are funded by assessments, using a formula derived from the regular funding scale that includes a weighted surcharge for the five permanent Security Council members, who must approve all peacekeeping operations. This surcharge serves to offset discounted peacekeeping assessment rates for less developed countries. \\nthe largest contributors for the UN peacekeeping  financial operations for the period 2019–2021 are\\xa0: the United States  27.89%  China 15.21%, Japan 8.56%, Germany 6.09% , the United Kingdom 5.78%, France 5.61%, Italy 3.30% and the Russian Federation 3.04%. [2]\\nSpecial UN programmes not included in the regular budget, such as UNICEF and the World Food Programme, are financed by voluntary contributions from member governments, corporations, and private individuals.[184][185]\\nA number of agencies and individuals associated with the UN have won the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of their work. Two Secretaries-General, Dag Hammarskjöld and Kofi Annan, were each awarded the prize (in 1961 and 2001, respectively), as were Ralph Bunche (1950), a UN negotiator, René Cassin (1968), a contributor to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the US Secretary of State Cordell Hull (1945), the latter for his role in the organization\\'s founding. Lester B. Pearson, the Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs, was awarded the prize in 1957 for his role in organizing the UN\\'s first peacekeeping force to resolve the Suez Crisis. UNICEF won the prize in 1965, the International Labour Organization in 1969, the UN Peace-Keeping Forces in 1988, the International Atomic Energy Agency (which reports to the UN) in 2005, and the UN-supported Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2013. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees was awarded in 1954 and 1981, becoming one of only two recipients to win the prize twice. The UN as a whole was awarded the prize in 2001, sharing it with Annan.[186] In 2007, IPCC received the prize \"for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change.\"[187]\\nSince its founding, there have been many calls for reform of the UN but little consensus on how to do so. Some want the UN to play a greater or more effective role in world affairs, while others want its role reduced to humanitarian work. There have also been numerous calls for the UN Security Council\\'s membership to be increased, for different ways of electing the UN\\'s Secretary-General, and for a UN Parliamentary Assembly. Jacques Fomerand states the most enduring divide in views of the UN is \"the North–South split\" between richer Northern nations and developing Southern nations. Southern nations tend to favour a more empowered UN with a stronger General Assembly, allowing them a greater voice in world affairs, while Northern nations prefer an economically laissez-faire UN that focuses on transnational threats such as terrorism.[188]\\nAfter World War II, the French Committee of National Liberation was late to be recognized by the US as the government of France, and so the country was initially excluded from the conferences that created the new organization. The future French president Charles de Gaulle criticized the UN, famously calling it a machin (\"contraption\"), and was not convinced that a global security alliance would help maintain world peace, preferring direct defence treaties between countries.[189] Throughout the Cold War, both the US and USSR repeatedly accused the UN of favouring the other. In 1953, the USSR effectively forced the resignation of Trygve Lie, the Secretary-General, through its refusal to deal with him, while in the 1950s and 1960s, a popular US bumper sticker read, \"You can\\'t spell communism without U.N.\"[190] In a sometimes-misquoted statement, President George W. Bush stated in February 2003 (referring to UN uncertainty towards Iraqi provocations under the Saddam Hussein regime) that \"free nations will not allow the UN to fade into history as an ineffective, irrelevant debating society.\"[191][192][193] In contrast, the French President, François Hollande, stated in 2012 that \"France trusts the United Nations. She knows that no state, no matter how powerful, can solve urgent problems, fight for development and bring an end to all crises ... France wants the UN to be the centre of global governance.\"[194] Critics such as Dore Gold, an Israeli diplomat, Robert S. Wistrich, a British scholar, Alan Dershowitz, an American legal scholar, Mark Dreyfus, an Australian politician, and the Anti-Defamation League consider UN attention to Israel\\'s treatment of Palestinians to be excessive.[195] In September 2015, Saudi Arabia\\'s Faisal bin Hassan Trad has been elected Chair of the UN Human Rights Council panel that appoints independent experts,[196] a move criticized by human rights groups.[197][198]\\nSince 1971, the Republic of China on Taiwan has been excluded from the UN and since then has always been rejected in new applications. Taiwanese citizens are also not allowed to enter the buildings of the United Nations with ROC passports. In this way, critics agree that the UN is failing its own development goals and guidelines. This criticism also brought pressure from the People\\'s Republic of China, which regards the territories administered by the ROC as their own territory.[199][200]\\nCritics have also accused the UN of bureaucratic inefficiency, waste, and corruption. In 1976, the General Assembly established the Joint Inspection Unit to seek out inefficiencies within the UN system. During the 1990s, the US withheld dues citing inefficiency and only started repayment on the condition that a major reforms initiative was introduced. In 1994, the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) was established by the General Assembly to serve as an efficiency watchdog.[201] In 1994, former Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the UN to Somalia Mohamed Sahnoun published \"Somalia: The Missed Opportunities\",[202] a book in which he analyses the reasons for the failure of the 1992 UN intervention in Somalia, showing that, between the start of the Somali civil war in 1988 and the fall of the Siad Barre regime in January 1991, the UN missed at least three opportunities to prevent major human tragedies; when the UN tried to provide humanitarian assistance, they were totally outperformed by NGOs, whose competence and dedication sharply contrasted with the UN\\'s excessive caution and bureaucratic inefficiencies. If radical reform was not undertaken, warned Mohamed Sahnoun, then the UN would continue to respond to such crisis with inept improvization.[203] In 2004, the UN faced accusations that its recently ended Oil-for-Food Programme—in which Iraq had been allowed to trade oil for basic needs to relieve the pressure of sanctions—had suffered from widespread corruption, including billions of dollars of kickbacks. An independent inquiry created by the UN found that many of its officials had been involved, as well as raising \"significant\" questions about the role of Kojo Annan, the son of Kofi Annan.[204]\\nIn evaluating the UN as a whole, Jacques Fomerand writes that the \"accomplishments of the United Nations in the last 60 years are impressive in their own terms. Progress in human development during the 20th century has been dramatic and the UN and its agencies have certainly helped the world become a more hospitable and livable place for millions.\"[205] Evaluating the first 50 years of the UN\\'s history, the author Stanley Meisler writes that \"the United Nations never fulfilled the hopes of its founders, but it accomplished a great deal nevertheless\", citing its role in decolonization and its many successful peacekeeping efforts.[206] The British historian Paul Kennedy states that while the organization has suffered some major setbacks, \"when all its aspects are considered, the UN has brought great benefits to our generation and ... will bring benefits to our children\\'s and grandchildren\\'s generations as well.\"[207]\\nOfficial websites\\nOther\\n'"

       "' The United Nations UN is an intergovernmental organization tasked with maintaining international peace and security developing friendly relations among nations achieving international co operation and being a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations It was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars and succeeded the ineffective League of Nations Its headquarters which are subject to extraterritoriality are in Manhattan New York City and it has other main offices in Geneva Nairobi Vienna and The Hague The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security protecting human rights delivering humanitarian aid promoting sustainable development and upholding international law The UN is the largest most familiar most internationally represented and most powerful intergovernmental organization in the world At its founding the UN had member states there are now On April governments met in San Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter which was adopted on June in the San Francisco Opera House and signed on June in the Herbst Theatre auditorium in the Veterans War Memorial Building This charter took effect on October when the UN began operations The organisation s mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades during the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies Its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring reporting and confidence building roles The organization s membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization which started in the s Since then former colonies had gained independence including trust territories which were monitored by the Trusteeship Council By the s its budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping After the end of the Cold War the UN shifted and expanded its field operations undertaking a wide variety of complex tasks The UN has six principal organs the General Assembly the Security Council the Economic and Social Council the Trusteeship Council the International Court of Justice and the UN Secretariat The UN System agencies include the World Bank Group the World Health Organization the World Food Programme UNESCO and UNICEF The UN s most prominent officer is the Secretary General an office held by Portuguese politician and diplomat Ant nio Guterres since January Non governmental organizations may be granted consultative status with ECOSOC and other agencies to participate in the UN s work The organization its officers and its agencies have won many Nobel Peace Prizes Other evaluations of the UN s effectiveness have been mixed Some commentators believe the organization to be an important force for peace and human development while others have called the organization ineffective biased or corrupt In the century prior to the UN s creation several international treaty organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross was formed to ensure protection and assistance for victims of armed conflict and strife In a political assassination in Sarajevo set off a chain of events that led to the outbreak of World War I As more and more young men were sent down into the trenches influential voices in the United States and Britain began calling for the establishment of a permanent international body to maintain peace in the postwar world President Woodrow Wilson became a vocal advocate of this concept and in he included a sketch of the international body in his point proposal to end the war In November the Central Powers agreed to an armistice to halt the killing in World War I Two months later the Allies met with Germany and Austria Hungary at Versailles to hammer out formal peace terms President Wilson wanted peace but the United Kingdom and France disagreed forcing harsh war reparations on their former enemies The League of Nations was approved and in the summer of Wilson presented the Treaty of Versailles and the Covenant of the League of Nations to the US Senate for ratification On January the League of Nations formally comes into being when the Covenant of the League of Nations ratified by nations in takes effect However at some point the League became ineffective when it failed to act against the Japanese invasion of Manchuria as in February nations voted for Japan to withdraw from Manchuria but Japan voted against it and walked out of the League instead of withdrawing from Manchuria It also failed against the Second Italo Ethiopian War despite trying to talk to Benito Mussolini as he used the time to send an army to Africa so the League had a plan for Mussolini to just take a part of Ethiopia but he ignored the League and invaded Ethiopia the League tried putting sanctions on Italy but Italy had already conquered Ethiopia and the League had failed After Italy conquered Ethiopia Italy and other nations left the league But all of them realised that it had failed and they began to re arm as fast as possible During Britain and France tried negotiating directly with Hitler but this failed in when Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia When war broke out in the League closed down and its headquarters in Geneva remained empty throughout the war The earliest concrete plan for a new world organization began under the aegis of the U S State Department in The text of the Declaration by United Nations was drafted at the White House on December by President Franklin D Roosevelt Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Roosevelt aide Harry Hopkins It incorporated Soviet suggestions but left no role for France Four Policemen was coined to refer to four major Allied countries United States United Kingdom Soviet Union and Republic of China which emerged in the Declaration by United Nations Roosevelt first coined the term United Nations to describe the Allied countries b On New Year s Day President Roosevelt Prime Minister Churchill Maxim Litvinov of the USSR and T V Soong of China signed a short document which later came to be known as the United Nations Declaration and the next day the representatives of twenty two other nations added their signatures The term United Nations was first officially used when governments signed this Declaration One major change from the Atlantic Charter was the addition of a provision for religious freedom which Stalin approved after Roosevelt insisted By March additional states had signed A JOINT DECLARATION BY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND THE UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS CHINA AUSTRALIA BELGIUM CANADA COSTA RICA CUBA CZECHOSLOVAKIA DOMINICAN REPUBLIC EL SALVADOR GREECE GUATEMALA HAITI HONDURAS INDIA LUXEMBOURG NETHERLANDS NEW ZEALAND NICARAGUA NORWAY PANAMA

to subjugate the world DECLARE The foregoing declaration may be adhered to by other nations which are or which may be rendering material assistance and contributions in the struggle for victory over Hitlerism During the war the United Nations became the official term for the Allies To join countries had to sign the Declaration and declare war on the Axis The UN was formulated and negotiated among the delegations from the Allied Big Four the United States the United Kingdom the Soviet Union and China at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference from September to October and they agreed on the aims structure and functioning of the UN After months of planning the UN Conference on International Organization opened in San Francisco April attended by governments and a number of non governmental organizations involved in drafting the UN Charter The heads of the delegations of the sponsoring countries took turns as chairman of the plenary meetings Anthony Eden of Britain Edward Stettinius of the United States T V Soong of China and Vyacheslav Molotov of the Soviet Union At the later meetings Lord Halifax deputized for Mister Eden Wellington Koo for T V Soong and Mister Gromyko for Mister Molotov The UN officially came into existence October upon ratification of the Charter by the five permanent members of the Security Council France the Republic of China the Soviet Union the UK and the US and by a majority of the other signatories The first meetings of the General Assembly with nations represented c and the Security Council took place in Methodist Central Hall Westminster London beginning on January The General Assembly selected New York City as the site for the headquarters of the UN construction began on September and the facility was completed on October Its site like UN headquarters buildings in Geneva Vienna and Nairobi is designated as international territory The Norwegian Foreign Minister Trygve Lie was elected as the first UN Secretary General Though the UN s primary mandate was peacekeeping the division between the US and USSR often paralysed the organization generally allowing it to intervene only in conflicts distant from the Cold War Two notable exceptions were a Security Council resolution on July authorizing a US led coalition to repel the North Korean invasion of South Korea passed in the absence of the USSR and the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement in July On November the General Assembly approved a resolution to partition Palestine approving the creation of the state of Israel Two years later Ralph Bunche a UN official negotiated an armistice to the resulting conflict On November the first UN peacekeeping force was established to end the Suez Crisis however the UN was unable to intervene against the USSR s simultaneous invasion of Hungary following that country s revolution On July the UN established United Nations Operation in the Congo UNOC the largest military force of its early decades to bring order to the breakaway State of Katanga restoring it to the control of the Democratic Republic of the Congo by May While travelling to meet rebel leader Moise Tshombe during the conflict Dag Hammarskj ld often named as one of the UN s most effective Secretaries General died in a plane crash months later he was posthumously awarded the Nobel Peace Prize In Hammarskj ld s successor U Thant deployed the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus which would become one of the UN s longest running peacekeeping missions With the spread of decolonization in the s the organization s membership saw an influx of newly independent nations In alone new states joined the UN of them from Africa On October with opposition from the United States but with the support of many Third World nations the mainland communist People s Republic of China was given the Chinese seat on the Security Council in place of the Republic of China that occupied Taiwan the vote was widely seen as a sign of waning US influence in the organization Third World nations organized into the Group of coalition under the leadership of Algeria which briefly became a dominant power at the UN On November a bloc comprising the USSR and Third World nations passed a resolution over strenuous US and Israeli opposition declaring Zionism to be racism the resolution was repealed on December shortly after the end of the Cold War With an increasing Third World presence and the failure of UN mediation in conflicts in the Middle East Vietnam and Kashmir the UN increasingly shifted its attention to its ostensibly secondary goals of economic development and cultural exchange By the s the UN budget for social and economic development was far greater than its peacekeeping budget After the Cold War the UN saw a radical expansion in its peacekeeping duties taking on more missions in ten years than it had in the previous four decades Between and the number of adopted Security Council resolutions more than doubled and the peacekeeping budget increased more than tenfold The UN negotiated an end to the Salvadoran Civil War launched a successful peacekeeping mission in Namibia and oversaw democratic elections in post apartheid South Africa and post Khmer Rouge Cambodia In the UN authorized a US led coalition that repulsed the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait Brian Urquhart Under Secretary General from to later described the hopes raised by these successes as a false renaissance for the organization given the more troubled missions that followed Though the UN Charter had been written primarily to prevent aggression by one nation against another in the early s the UN faced a number of simultaneous serious crises within nations such as Somalia Haiti Mozambique and the former Yugoslavia The UN mission in Somalia was widely viewed as a failure after the US withdrawal following casualties in the Battle of Mogadishu and the UN mission to Bosnia faced worldwide ridicule for its indecisive and confused mission in the face of ethnic cleansing In the UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda failed to intervene in the Rwandan genocide amid indecision in the Security Council Beginning in the last decades of the Cold War American and European critics of the UN condemned the organization for perceived mismanagement and corruption In the US President Ronald Reagan withdrew his nation s funding from UNESCO the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization founded over allegations of mismanagement followed by Britain and Singapore Boutros Boutros Ghali Secretary General from to initiated a reform of the Secretariat reducing the size of the organization somewhat His successor Kofi Annan initiated further management reforms in the face of threats from the United States to withhold its UN dues In the late s and s international interventions authorized by the UN took a wider variety of forms The UN mission in the Sierra Leone Civil War of was supplemented by British Royal Marines and the invasion of Afghanistan in was overseen by NATO In the United States invaded Iraq despite failing to pass a UN Security Council resolution for authorization prompting a new round of questioning of the organization s effectiveness Under the eighth Secretary General Ban Ki moon the UN has intervened with peacekeepers in crises including the War in Darfur in Sudan and the Kivu conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and sent observers and chemical weapons inspectors to the Syrian Civil War In an internal review of UN actions in the final battles of the Sri Lankan Civil War in concluded that the organization had suffered systemic failure One hundred and one UN personnel died in the Haiti earthquake the worst loss of life in the organization s history The Millennium Summit was held in to discuss the UN s role in the st century The three day meeting was the largest gathering of world leaders in history and culminated in the adoption by all member states of the Millennium Development Goals MDGs a commitment to achieve international development in areas such as poverty reduction gender equality and public health Progress towards these goals which were to be met by was ultimately uneven The World Summit reaffirmed the UN s focus on promoting development peacekeeping human rights and global security The Sustainable Development Goals were launched in to succeed the Millennium Development Goals In addition to addressing global challenges the UN has sought to improve its accountability and democratic legitimacy by engaging more with civil society and fostering a global constituency In an effort to enhance transparency in the organization held its first public debate between candidates for Secretary General On January Portuguese diplomat Ant nio Guterres who previously served as UN High Commissioner for Refugees became the ninth Secretary General Guterres has highlighted several key goals for his administration including an emphasis on diplomacy for preventing conflicts more effective peacekeeping efforts and streamlining the organization to be more responsive and versatile to global needs The UN system is based on five principal organs the General Assembly the Security Council the Economic and Social Council ECOSOC the International Court of Justice and the UN Secretariat A sixth principal organ the Trusteeship Council suspended operations on November upon the independence of Palau the last remaining UN trustee territory Four of the five principal organs are located at the main UN Headquarters in New York City The International Court of Justice is located in The Hague while other major agencies are based in the UN offices at Geneva Vienna and Nairobi Other UN institutions are located throughout the world The six official languages of the UN used in intergovernmental meetings and documents are Arabic Chinese English French Russian and Spanish On the basis of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations the UN and its agencies are immune from the laws of the countries where they operate safeguarding the UN s impartiality with regard to the host and member countries Below the six organs sit in the words of the author Linda Fasulo an amazing collection of entities and organizations some of which are actually older than the UN itself and operate with almost complete independence from it These include specialized agencies research and training institutions programmes and funds and other UN entities The UN obey the Noblemaire principle which is binding on any organization that belongs to the UN system This principle calls for salaries that will draw and keep citizens of countries where salaries are highest and also calls for equal pay for work of equal value independent of the employee s nationality In practice the ICSC takes reference to the highest paying national civil service Staff salaries are subject to an internal tax that is administered by the UN organizations The General Assembly is the main deliberative assembly of the UN Composed of all UN member states the assembly meets in regular yearly sessions but emergency sessions can also be called The assembly is led by a president elected from among the member states on a rotating regional basis and vice presidents The first session convened January in the Methodist Central Hall in London and included representatives of nations When the General Assembly decides on important questions such as those on peace and security admission of new members and budgetary matters a two thirds majority of those present and voting is required All other questions are decided by a majority vote Each member country has one vote Apart from approval of budgetary matters resolutions are not binding on the members The Assembly may make recommendations on any matters within the scope of the UN except matters of peace and security that are under consideration by the Security Council Draft resolutions can be forwarded to the General Assembly by its six main committees As well as by the following two committees The Security Council is charged with maintaining peace and security among countries While other organs of the UN can only make recommendations to member states the Security Council has the power to make binding decisions that member states have agreed to carry out under the terms of Charter Article The decisions of the Council are known as United Nations Security Council resolutions The Security Council is made up of fifteen member states consisting of five permanent members China France Russia the United Kingdom and the United States and ten non permanent members elected for two year terms by the General Assembly with end of term date Belgium term ends C te d Ivoire Dominican Republic Equatorial Guinea Germany Indonesia Kuwait Peru Poland and South Africa The five permanent members hold veto power over UN resolutions allowing a permanent member to block adoption of a resolution though not debate The ten temporary seats are held for two year terms with five member states per year voted in by the General Assembly on a regional basis The presidency of the Security Council rotates alphabetically each month The UN Secretariat is headed by the Secretary General assisted by the Deputy Secretary General and a staff of international civil servants worldwide It provides studies information and facilities needed by UN bodies for their meetings It also carries out tasks as directed by the Security Council the General Assembly the Economic and Social Council and other UN bodies The Secretary General acts as the de facto spokesperson and leader of the UN The position is defined in the UN Charter as the organization s chief administrative officer Article of the charter states that the Secretary General can bring to the Security Council s attention any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security a phrase that Secretaries General since Trygve Lie have interpreted as giving the position broad scope for action on the world stage The office has evolved into a dual role of an administrator of the UN organization and a diplomat and mediator addressing disputes between member states and finding consensus to global issues The Secretary General is appointed by the General Assembly after being recommended by the Security Council where the permanent members have veto power There are no specific criteria for the post but over the years it has become accepted that the post shall be held for one or two terms of five years The current Secretary General is Ant nio Guterres who replaced Ban Ki moon in The International Court of Justice ICJ located in The Hague in the Netherlands is the primary judicial organ of the UN Established in by the UN Charter the Court began work in as the successor to the Permanent Court of International Justice The ICJ is composed of judges who serve year terms and are appointed by the General Assembly every sitting judge must be from a different nation It is based in the Peace Palace in The Hague sharing the building with the Hague Academy of International Law a private centre for the study of international law The ICJ s primary purpose is to adjudicate disputes among states The court has heard cases related to war crimes illegal state interference ethnic cleansing and other issues The ICJ can also be called upon by other UN organs to provide advisory opinions It is the only organ that is not located in New York The Economic and Social Council ECOSOC assists the General Assembly in promoting international economic and social co operation and development ECOSOC has members which are elected by the General Assembly for a three year term The president is elected for a one year term and chosen amongst the small or middle powers represented on ECOSOC The council has one annual meeting in July held in either New York or Geneva Viewed as separate from the specialized bodies it co ordinates ECOSOC s functions include information gathering advising member nations and making recommendations Owing to its broad mandate of co ordinating many agencies ECOSOC has at times been criticized as unfocused or irrelevant ECOSOC s subsidiary bodies include the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues which advises UN agencies on issues relating to indigenous peoples the United Nations Forum on Forests which co ordinates and promotes sustainable forest management the United Nations Statistical Commission which co ordinates information gathering efforts between agencies and the Commission on Sustainable Development which co ordinates efforts between UN agencies and NGOs working towards sustainable development ECOSOC may also grant consultative status to non governmental organizations by more than organizations had received this status The UN Charter stipulates that each primary organ of the United Nations can establish various specialized agencies to fulfil its duties Some best known agencies are the International Atomic Energy Agency the Food and Agriculture Organization UNESCO United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization the World Bank and the World Health Organization WHO The UN performs most of its humanitarian work through these agencies Examples include mass vaccination programmes through WHO the avoidance of famine and malnutrition through the work of the WFP and the protection of vulnerable and displaced people for example by UNHCR With the addition of South Sudan July there are UN member states including all undisputed independent states apart from Vatican City d The UN Charter outlines the rules for membership In addition there are two non member observer states of the United Nations General Assembly the Holy See which holds sovereignty over Vatican City and the State of Palestine The Cook Islands and Niue both states in free association with New Zealand are full members of several UN specialized agencies and have had their full treaty making capacity recognized by the Secretariat The Group of at the UN is a loose coalition of developing nations designed to promote its members collective economic interests and create an enhanced joint negotiating capacity in the UN Seventy seven nations founded the organization but by November the organization had since expanded to member countries The group was founded June by the Joint Declaration of the Seventy Seven Countries issued at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD The group held its first major meeting in Algiers in where it adopted the Charter of Algiers and established the basis for permanent institutional structures The UN after approval by the Security Council sends peacekeepers to regions where armed conflict has recently ceased or paused to enforce the terms of peace agreements and to discourage combatants from resuming hostilities Since the UN does not maintain its own military peacekeeping forces are voluntarily provided by member states These soldiers are sometimes nicknamed Blue Helmets for their distinctive gear The peacekeeping force as a whole received the Nobel Peace Prize in In September the UN had peacekeeping soldiers deployed on missions The largest was the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo MONUSCO which included uniformed personnel The smallest United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan UNMOGIP included uniformed personnel responsible for monitoring the ceasefire in Jammu and Kashmir UN peacekeepers with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization UNTSO have been stationed in the Middle East since the longest running active peacekeeping mission A study by the RAND Corporation in found the UN to be successful in two out of three peacekeeping efforts It compared efforts at nation building by the UN to those of the United States and found that seven out of eight UN cases are at peace as compared with four out of eight US cases at peace Also in the Human Security Report documented a decline in the number of wars genocides and human rights abuses since the end of the Cold War and presented evidence albeit circumstantial that international activism mostly spearheaded by the UN has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict in that period Situations in which the UN has not only acted to keep the peace but also intervened include the Korean War and the authorization of intervention in Iraq after the Gulf War The UN has also drawn criticism for perceived failures In many cases member states have shown reluctance to achieve or enforce Security Council resolutions Disagreements in the Security Council about military action and intervention are seen as having failed to prevent the Bangladesh genocide in the Cambodian genocide in the s and the Rwandan genocide in Similarly UN inaction is blamed for failing to either prevent the Srebrenica massacre in or complete the peacekeeping operations in during the Somali Civil War UN peacekeepers have also been accused of child rape soliciting prostitutes and sexual abuse during various peacekeeping missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Haiti Liberia Sudan and what is now South Sudan Burundi and Ivory Coast Scientists cited UN peacekeepers from Nepal as the likely source of the Haiti cholera outbreak which killed more than Haitians following the Haiti earthquake In addition to peacekeeping the UN is also active in encouraging disarmament Regulation of armaments was included in the writing of the UN Charter in and was envisioned as a way of limiting the use of human and economic resources for their creation The advent of nuclear weapons came only weeks after the signing of the charter resulting in the first resolution of the first General Assembly meeting calling for specific proposals for the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and of all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction The UN has been involved with arms limitation treaties such as the Outer Space Treaty the Treaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons the Seabed Arms Control Treaty the Biological Weapons Convention the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Ottawa Treaty which prohibits landmines Three UN bodies oversee arms proliferation issues the International Atomic Energy Agency the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission One of the UN s primary purposes is promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race sex language or religion and member states pledge to undertake joint and separate action to protect these rights In the General Assembly adopted a Universal Declaration of Human Rights drafted by a committee headed by American diplomat and activist Eleanor Roosevelt and including the French lawyer Ren Cassin The document proclaims basic civil political and economic rights common to all human beings though its effectiveness towards achieving these ends has been disputed since its drafting The Declaration serves as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations rather than a legally binding document but it has become the basis of two binding treaties the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights In practice the UN is unable to take significant action against human rights abuses without a Security Council resolution though it does substantial work in investigating and reporting abuses In the General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women followed by the Convention on the Rights of the Child in With the end of the Cold War the push for human rights action took on new impetus The United Nations Commission on Human Rights was formed in to oversee human rights issues for the UN following the recommendation of that year s World Conference on Human Rights Jacques Fomerand a scholar of the UN describes this organization s mandate as broad and vague with only meagre resources to carry it out In it was replaced by a Human Rights Council consisting of nations Also in the General Assembly passed a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and in it passed its first resolution recognizing the rights of LGBT people Other UN bodies responsible for women s rights issues include United Nations Commission on the Status of Women a commission of ECOSOC founded in the United Nations Development Fund for Women created in and the United Nations International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women founded in The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues one of three bodies with a mandate to oversee issues related to indigenous peoples held its first session in Millennium Development Goals Another primary purpose of the UN is to achieve international co operation in solving international problems of an economic social cultural or humanitarian character Numerous bodies have been created to work towards this goal primarily under the authority of the General Assembly and ECOSOC In the UN member states agreed to achieve eight Millennium Development Goals by The Sustainable Development Goals were launched in to succeed the Millennium Development Goals The SDGs have an associated financing framework called the Addis Ababa Action Agenda The UN Development Programme UNDP an organization for grant based technical assistance founded in is one of the leading bodies in the field of international development The organization also publishes the UN Human Development Index a comparative measure ranking countries by poverty literacy education life expectancy and other factors The Food and Agriculture Organization FAO also founded in promotes agricultural development and food security UNICEF the United Nations Children s Fund was created in to aid European children after the Second World War and expanded its mission to provide aid around the world and to uphold the Convention on the Rights of the Child The World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund IMF are independent specialized agencies and observers within the UN framework according to a agreement They were initially formed separately from the UN through the Bretton Woods Agreement in The World Bank provides loans for international development while the IMF promotes international economic co operation and gives emergency loans to indebted countries The World Health Organization WHO which focuses on international health issues and disease eradication is another of the UN s largest agencies In the agency announced that the eradication of smallpox had been completed In subsequent decades WHO largely eradicated polio river blindness and leprosy The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV AIDS UNAIDS begun in co ordinates the organization s response to the AIDS epidemic The UN Population Fund which also dedicates part of its resources to combating HIV is the world s largest source of funding for reproductive health and family planning services Along with the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement the UN often takes a leading role in co ordinating emergency relief The World Food Programme WFP created in provides food aid in response to famine natural disasters and armed conflict The organization reports that it feeds an average of million people in nations each year The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR established in works to protect the rights of refugees asylum seekers and stateless people UNHCR and WFP programmes are funded by voluntary contributions from governments corporations and individuals though the UNHCR s administrative costs are paid for by the UN s primary budget Since the UN s creation over colonies have attained independence The General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in with no votes against but abstentions from all major colonial powers The UN works towards decolonization through groups including the UN Committee on Decolonization created in The committee lists seventeen remaining Non Self Governing Territories the largest and most populous of which is Western Sahara Beginning with the formation of the UN Environmental Programme UNEP in the UN has made environmental issues a prominent part of its agenda A lack of success in the first two decades of UN work in this area led to the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro Brazil which sought to give new impetus to these efforts In the UNEP and the World Meteorological Organization WMO another UN organization established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which assesses and reports on research on global warming The UN sponsored Kyoto Protocol signed in set legally binding emissions reduction targets for ratifying states The UN also declares and co ordinates international observances periods of time to observe issues of international interest or concern Examples include World Tuberculosis Day Earth Day and the International Year of Deserts and Desertification The UN is financed from assessed and voluntary contributions from member states The General Assembly approves the regular budget and determines the assessment for each member This is broadly based on the relative capacity of each country to pay as measured by its gross national income GNI with adjustments for external debt and low per capita income The two year budget for was billion in total The Assembly has established the principle that the UN should not be unduly dependent on any one member to finance its operations Thus there is a ceiling rate setting the maximum amount that any member can be assessed for the regular budget In December the Assembly revised the scale of assessments in response to pressure from the United States As part of that revision the regular budget ceiling was reduced from to For the least developed countries LDCs a ceiling rate of is applied In addition to the ceiling rates the minimum amount assessed to any member nation or floor rate is set at of the UN budget for the two year budget A large share of the UN s expenditure addresses its core mission of peace and security and this budget is assessed separately from the main organizational budget The peacekeeping budget for the fiscal year was billion supporting troops deployed in missions around the world UN peace operations are funded by assessments using a formula derived from the regular funding scale that includes a weighted surcharge for the five permanent Security Council members who must approve all peacekeeping operations This surcharge serves to offset discounted peacekeeping assessment rates for less developed countries the largest contributors for the UN peacekeeping financial operations for the period are the United States China Japan Germany the United Kingdom France Italy and the Russian Federation Special UN programmes not included in the regular budget such as UNICEF and the World Food Programme are financed by voluntary contributions from member governments corporations and private individuals A number of agencies and individuals associated with the UN have won the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of their work Two Secretaries General Dag Hammarskj ld and Kofi Annan were each awarded the prize in and respectively as were Ralph Bunche a UN negotiator Ren Cassin a contributor to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the US Secretary of State Cordell Hull the latter for his role in the organization s founding Lester B Pearson the Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs was awarded the prize in for his role in organizing the UN s first peacekeeping force to resolve the Suez Crisis UNICEF won the prize in the International Labour Organization in the UN Peace Keeping Forces in the International Atomic Energy Agency which reports to the UN in and the UN supported Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in The UN High Commissioner for Refugees was awarded in and becoming one of only two recipients to win the prize twice The UN as a whole was awarded the prize in sharing it with Annan In IPCC received the prize for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change Since its founding there have been many calls for reform of the UN but little consensus on how to do so Some want the UN to play a greater or more effective role in world affairs while others want its role reduced to humanitarian work There have also been numerous calls for the UN Security Council s membership to be increased for different ways of electing the UN s Secretary General and for a UN Parliamentary Assembly Jacques Fomerand states the most enduring divide in views of the UN is the North South split between richer Northern nations and developing Southern nations Southern nations tend to favour a more empowered UN with a stronger General Assembly allowing them a greater voice in world affairs while Northern nations prefer an economically laissez faire UN that focuses on transnational threats such as terrorism After World War II the French Committee of National Liberation was late to be recognized by the US as the government of France and so the country was initially excluded from the conferences that created the new organization The future French president Charles de Gaulle criticized the UN famously calling it a machin contraption and was not convinced that a global security alliance would help maintain world peace preferring direct defence treaties between countries Throughout the Cold War both the US and USSR repeatedly accused the UN of favouring the other In the USSR effectively forced the resignation of Trygve Lie the Secretary General through its refusal to deal with him while in the s and s a popular US bumper sticker read You can t spell communism without U N In a sometimes misquoted statement President George W Bush stated in February referring to UN uncertainty towards Iraqi provocations under the Saddam Hussein regime that free nations will not allow the UN to fade into history as an ineffective irrelevant debating society In contrast the French President Fran ois Hollande stated in that France trusts the United Nations She knows that no state no matter how powerful can solve urgent problems fight for development and bring an end to all crises France wants the UN to be the centre of global governance Critics such as Dore Gold an Israeli diplomat Robert S Wistrich a British scholar Alan Dershowitz an American legal scholar Mark Dreyfus an Australian politician and the Anti Defamation League consider UN attention to Israel s treatment of Palestinians to be excessive In September Saudi Arabia s Faisal bin Hassan Trad has been elected Chair of the UN Human Rights Council panel that appoints independent experts a move criticized by human rights groups Since the Republic of China on Taiwan has been excluded from the UN and since then has always been rejected in new applications Taiwanese citizens are also not allowed to enter the buildings of the United Nations with ROC passports In this way critics agree that the UN is failing its own development goals and guidelines This criticism also brought pressure from the People s Republic of China which regards the territories administered by the ROC as their own territory Critics have also accused the UN of bureaucratic inefficiency waste and corruption In the General Assembly established the Joint Inspection Unit to seek out inefficiencies within the UN system During the s the US withheld dues citing inefficiency and only started repayment on the condition that a major reforms initiative was introduced In the Office of Internal Oversight Services OIOS was established by the General Assembly to serve as an efficiency watchdog In former Special Representative of the Secretary General of the UN to Somalia Mohamed Sahnoun published Somalia The Missed Opportunities a book in which he analyses the reasons for the failure of the UN intervention in Somalia showing that between the start of the Somali civil war in and the fall of the Siad Barre regime in January the UN missed at least three opportunities to prevent major human tragedies when the UN tried to provide humanitarian assistance they were totally outperformed by NGOs whose competence and dedication sharply contrasted with the UN s excessive caution and bureaucratic inefficiencies If radical reform was not undertaken warned Mohamed Sahnoun then the UN would continue to respond to such crisis with inept improvization In the UN faced accusations that its recently ended Oil for Food Programme in which Iraq had been allowed to trade oil for basic needs to relieve the pressure of sanctions had suffered from widespread corruption including billions of dollars of kickbacks An independent inquiry created by the UN found that many of its officials had been involved as well as raising significant questions about the role of Kojo Annan the son of Kofi Annan In evaluating the UN as a whole Jacques Fomerand writes that the accomplishments of the United Nations in the last years are impressive in their own terms Progress in human development during the th century has been dramatic and the UN and its agencies have certainly helped the world become a more hospitable and livable place for millions Evaluating the first years of the UN s history the author Stanley Meisler writes that the United Nations never fulfilled the hopes of its founders but it accomplished a great deal nevertheless citing its role in decolonization and its many successful peacekeeping efforts The British historian Paul Kennedy states that while the organization has suffered some major setbacks when all its aspects are considered the UN has brought great benefits to our generation and will bring benefits to our children s and grandchildren s generations as well Official websites Other '"

      "Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, protecting human rights, delivering humanitarian aid, promoting sustainable development, and upholding international law. Seventy-seven nations founded the organization, but by November 2013 the organization had since expanded to 133 member countries. Some commentators believe the organization to be an important force for peace and human development, while others have called the organization ineffective, biased, or corrupt. The UN Development Programme (UNDP), an organization for grant-based technical assistance founded in 1945, is one of the leading bodies in the field of international development. The World Health Organization (WHO), which focuses on international health issues and disease eradication, is another of the UN's largest agencies. In 1988, the UNEP and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), another UN organization, established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which assesses and reports on research on global warming. The UN System agencies include the World Bank Group, the World Health Organization, the World Food Programme, UNESCO, and UNICEF.\n"

      "The UN has six principal organs: the General Assembly; the Security Council; the Economic and Social Council; the Trusteeship Council; the International Court of Justice; and the UN Secretariat. There have also been numerous calls for the UN Security Council's membership to be increased, for different ways of electing the UN's Secretary-General, and for a UN Parliamentary Assembly. The UN obey the Noblemaire principle, which is binding on any organization that belongs to the UN system. The UN works towards decolonization through groups including the UN Committee on Decolonization, created in 1962. The International Court of Justice is located in The Hague, while other major agencies are based in the UN offices at Geneva, Vienna, and Nairobi. In 1964, Hammarskjöld's successor, U Thant, deployed the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, which would become one of the UN's longest-running peacekeeping missions. The International Court of Justice (ICJ), located in The Hague, in the Netherlands, is the primary judicial organ of the UN.\n"
